# RotTPMS-Plates
This repository provides the basic source code of the investigation on the rotating triply periodic minimal surface (RotTPMS) plate structures with the following features:
- Verification of the transformation of the elastic constitutive matrix;
- Formulation of novel material rotation method;
- Three TPMS types (P, G, IWP)
- Quasi-3D six-variable higher-order shear deformation plate theory, isogeometric analysis (IGA); 
- Two analyses of square plate (static and free vibration);
